## 📌 Overview
This project is a Python application for solving mazes using different algorithms.  
It provides a Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to load mazes, set start and end points, and visualize the solution path.

---

## 🎯 Key Features
- Built with **Tkinter** for an interactive and easy-to-use interface.
- Load mazes from text files and customize start/end points.
- Solve mazes using multiple algorithms:
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
  - **A\***
  - **Genetic Algorithm**
- Visualize maze solutions step by step.
- Genetic Algorithm includes evolutionary operations such as **selection** and **mutation** for optimized pathfinding.
